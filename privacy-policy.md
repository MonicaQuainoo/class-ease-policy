Creating a feature graphic for your app is a great way to visually showcase your app's branding and features. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create one:

1. Use a Graphic Design Tool
There are several online tools and software that can help you create a feature graphic, even if you don’t have prior design experience. Some popular options include:

Canva (easy-to-use and has templates)
Adobe Spark (offers custom dimensions)
Figma (more advanced, good for collaborative design)
Photoshop (professional, but requires experience)
2. Set the Correct Dimensions
When starting your design, ensure the canvas is set to 1,024 px by 500 px (as specified). Most design tools allow you to set custom dimensions for your project.

3. Design Elements to Include
Here are some tips on what to include in your feature graphic:

Logo: Place your app logo somewhere visible.
App Name: Include the name of the app ("UCCHostels") in a large, easy-to-read font.
Tagline or Message: Add a catchy tagline that explains the app's purpose, e.g., "Find affordable student hostels with ease!"
Brand Colors: Use your app's color scheme to maintain branding consistency.
Visuals: Use relevant visuals like pictures of hostels, students, or university campuses to represent your app’s services.
4. Keep It Simple and Clean
A feature graphic should be visually appealing but not too cluttered. Focus on key elements that represent your app’s purpose. Use bold text, minimal colors, and eye-catching images.

5. Export Your Image
Once you're satisfied with your design:

Download the image as a PNG or JPEG file.
Ensure the file size is under 15 MB.
Double-check that the dimensions are 1,024 px by 500 px.
6. Upload to Your App Store Listing
After creating your feature graphic, you can upload it to your app’s listing in the Google Play Store or Apple App Store as part of your app’s promotional material.
